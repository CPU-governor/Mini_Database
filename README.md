# Mini_Database
A simple Database for a file record System in C
# About the project
it's a simple Database that keeps track of items in store or warehouse, it store's data about each product's quantity, price, and maybe even supplier's information.
# How it works?
it uses the principles of structures and file handling  in C.
for example consider this basic struct
```c
struct Item {
 char Item_name[25];
 float price;
 int quantity;
}
```
And if you don't know how structures works i recommend you watch a quick youtube tutorial on structures; as i do not need to explain this.
you will also need an understanding of file management in C (fopen, fwrite)


l'm using this project to practicalize my knowledge on C.
